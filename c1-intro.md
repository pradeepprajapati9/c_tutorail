c is gernal purpose programming languages it knowns as a low level langages c is mother 
languages it is also knows as a middle levle language.
C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie atthe Bell Laboratories in 1972.

why c is mother language becuase if your know c syntex  the other programming languase same syntex such as java c# c++ python etc.

c is fast other programming languages such as java python etc.

#=> it is preproccesor directive 
Header Files=>The #include directives at the beginning of the program are used to include header files. Header files provide function prototypes and definitions that allow the C compiler to understand the functions used in the program.

Main Function:=>Every C program starts with the main function. It is the program's entry point, and execution starts from here. The main function has a return type of int, indicating that it should return an integer value to the operating system upon completion.

Variable Declarations:=>Before using any variables, you should declare them with their data types. This section is typically placed after the main function's curly opening brace.

Return Statement:=>Use the return statement to terminate a function and return a value to the caller function. A return statement with a value of 0 typically indicates a successful execution in the main function, whereas a non-zero value indicates an error or unexpected termination.

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Characters are surrounded by single quotes


## for running your code or for compiling do this :
1. first of install gcc file 
2. create xyz file for write the code after write the code
3. press ctrl+ backtic (tab above)
4. gcc your file name .c press enter
5. ./a.out press enter 


## basic formate of specifiers:
%d or %i	int	
%f or %F	float	
%lf	        double	
%c	        char	
%s	        Used for strings (text), which you will learn more about in a later chapter
